# Fantasypl2020

This project uses data from [understat.com](https://understat.com/league/EPL) and official Fantasy Premier League(FPL) data to generate a FPL team.

If you are putting the datasets together yourself, they need to manually edited (for now) as a lot of the names don't match between datasets.

If you are familiar with it I would recommend using the angular version of this project as that is much faster

## keys_pl_understat
This table has matched ids for the understat data and the fpl data.  Players from promoted teams and players who just transfered to the premier league are missing their connection as of 21/08/2020

## Running
