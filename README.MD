# Fantasypl2020

This project uses data from [understat.com](https://understat.com/league/EPL) and official Fantasy Premier League(FPL) data to generate a FPL team.

If you are putting the datasets together yourself, they need to manually edited (for now) as a lot of the names don't match between datasets.

If you are familiar with it I would recommend using the angular version of this project as that is much faster
